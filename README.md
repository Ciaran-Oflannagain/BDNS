# Building Device Naming Standards initiative

This repository holds resources for an initiative to improve interoperability in building management, by focusing on standardising naming of connected devices.

Achieving a common standard across building devicesâ€™ naming is an important first step towards being able to efficiently collect, analyse and capture data insights from buildings, and thus optimise building performance to reduce the operational cost and environmental impact of managing buildings.

Longer-term, this sets the groundwork for real industry collaboration - with the potential to create industry-wide benchmarking, and to facilitate trading of buildings between portfolios.

The work of this community group will align with and complement other initiatives in the industry such as BRICK, Haystack, Omniclass, Uniclass, IFC etc.

In scope for this work are:
- A [specification for naming syntax](BDNS_Specification_naming_syntax.md)
- A [register of building device type abbreviations](BDNS_Abbreviations_Register.csv)
