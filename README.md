# Building Device Naming Standards initiative

This repository holds resources for an initiative to improve interoperability in building management, by focusing on standardising naming of connected devices.

Being able to efficiently collect, analyse and leverage data insights from buildings is a catalyst for optimising building performance, improving the use of resources and moving towards predictive maintenance and buildings that can respond  to the climate emergency.

The lack of standardised naming and labelling for connected devices in the built environment means we are failing to leverage the value of data to allow interoperability, improve building efficiency and increase occupant productivity.

A naming and labelling standard (complementing other industry initiatives) will simplify and drive consistency thus increasing value by unlocking the application of technologies such as machine learning.  

The work of this community group will align with and complement other initiatives in the industry such as BRICK, Haystack, Omniclass, Uniclass, IFC etc.

In scope for this work are:
- A [specification for naming syntax](BDNS_Specification_naming_syntax.md)
- A [register of building device type abbreviations](BDNS_Abbreviations_Register.csv)

## Note
At the moment of release 1.0, the standard is focusing on naming of building control devices. 

With time it will also include maintainable asset names.
